# unit-4-game

Created a javascript that uses user clicks.
Depending on what gem the user clicks it effects their score differently.
I saw that the best way to tackle this was to create the crystals as an object and assign their values in there.
Also I got a chance to use a switch case and get more familiar with that syntax.
